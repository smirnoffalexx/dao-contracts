The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n * constructor() {\n *     _disableInitializers();\n * }\n * ```\n * ====\n */\nabstract contract Initializable {\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\n     * @custom:oz-retyped-from bool\n     */\n    uint8 private _initialized;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\n     */\n    bool private _initializing;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\n     */\n    event Initialized(uint8 version);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.

In addition to their inherent function as a unit of calculation, tokens can also be used as votes and as a unit indicating the degree of participation of an address in an off-chain or on-chain pool project. Tokens of any type can only be issued within the framework of a TGE (Token Generation Event), and by using vesting settings, such a TGE can divide the issuance of purchased or airdropped tokens into stages, as well as temporarily block the ability to transfer them from one address to another.\r\n * @dev An expanded ERC20 contract, based on which tokens of various types are issued. At the moment, the protocol provides for 2 types of tokens: Governance, which must be created simultaneously with the pool, existing for the pool only in the singular and participating in voting, and Preference, which may be several for one pool and which do not participate in voting in any way.\r\n */\r\ncontract Token is ERC20CappedUpgradeable, ERC20VotesUpgradeable, IToken {\r\n    /// @dev Service contract address\r\n    IService public service;\r\n\r\n    /// @dev Pool contract address\r\n    address public pool;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n    * @notice Token type code\r\n    * @dev Code \"1\" - Governance Token is the main token of the pool, compatible with the ERC20 standard.
